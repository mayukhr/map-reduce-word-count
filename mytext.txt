The Airavatesvara Shiva temple has a water tank. This tank has a connected channel that brings in Cauveri River water where Hindus gather annually to take a dip. The local mythology narrates how Airavata, or Indra's (malla) white elephant was restored with clean, white skin after he took a dip in this tank. This legend is carved in stone in the inner shrine, and this Indra's elephant gives this temple its name.

Quite a simple entrance right? Not so distinguishable amongst the thousands of other brilliant temples in Tamilnadu and Karnataka.

Even when I entered the gopuram, and saw the temple from a distance for first time, I could not fathom the brilliance awaiting for me in next few steps! Well, lets take a look at the main temple now

This temple has a Diamond shaped layout. And this is the largest of the Hoysala Temples. But, lets not get carried away by its size and shape. I had no idea, the details(both in exterior and interior) can be so mesmerizing. I will give you an example at this point

The temple has lights in the interior. And is only lit on the purchase of ticket of INR 30. Can be purchased inside the temple. I highly recommend this as flash photography might be prohibited inside the temple.

To conclude, this temple is only 25 Kms from Chikmagaluru. Even if you are on a day trip, do pay a visit.
